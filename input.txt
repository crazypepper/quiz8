  The working directory is     supposed
to contain a file named input.txt.

A file named output.txt is created and all words in input.txt are

  written in output.txt, one per line: FIRST the first one, THEN the last one,
 THEN the second one,
THEN the penultimate one, etc.

As usual, a word is a sequence of (lowercase or uppercase) letters
of maximal length. Here*(^are_()some$^&*$%@words<>?separated

678by#@$%&*87other)*(characters>>>>>>>>>>than_+)_)



     spaces!!

DO NOT TRY AND STORE THE WORDS IN AN ARRAY, OUTPUT THEM ON THE FLY!!!
